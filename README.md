# Taxi Hotspot Clustering and proximity recommendation system
Through this project, we try to predict the best possible way to find the number of hotspots feasible for taxis in a city. As input, we take the pickup points's latitude and longitude as coordinates.Using these coordinates we try to predict the regions/hotspots, where there could be highest possibibilty of getting a taxi. Using this, the business can actually report the waiting spots/hot spots to be made. So that the customers can go to these hotspots to get a taxi booked. Along with this, the project can be further extended  as an application, where on the basis of customers current latitude and longitude, the model can recommend him/her the nearest hotspot.
